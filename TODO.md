## Investigations
### Endoscope Suitability
- Glare is going to be the primary concern here, the 2MP endoscope seems to deal with it better than the standard one does. 
- Resolution seem suitable. We'll need the right C collars for mounting the larger camera to the gantry head.

### Piece-flipper
- Flipping puzzle pieces requires some sort of servo-driven mechanism.

### Selecting pieces from box
- While most of the time we'll know the exact height of the pieces, making it easy to select them, pulling the pieces out of the box requires deep topological knowledge.
- Looking at something like the LeapMotion controller to generate a topographic depth map of the puzzle box.

## Parts
### Acquired
- LitePlacer Kit
- 2MP USB Digital Microscope Webcam

### Needed
- Power supply for LitePlacer: 24VDC, 5-6 amps
- Wiring for machine: 
 - XLR connectors
 - 4 core cable for stepper motors
 - 2 core cable for limit switches, LED light rings, pumps, and solonoid
 - 3 core cable for servos (piece flipper)

### Long term
- Set of extrusions and axels for larger surface area
